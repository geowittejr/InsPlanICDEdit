404 ERRORS ON IIS6

When trying to run this Web API site on IIS 6, I kept getting 404 errors.
I solved my issue with the workaround described here for inserting a wildcard application mapping to aspnet_isapi_dll.
Here are the steps to add a wildcard application map to the .NET isapi dll:
	1. On the Web API IIS site, click on the "Configuration" button on the directory tab.
	2. When the dialog opens, click the "Insert" button.
	3. Enter the executable path as the isapi_dll path, "c:\windows\microsoft.net\framework\v4.0.30319\aspnet_isapi.dll".
	4. Make sure that you uncheck the "Verify that file exists" box.
	5. Click "OK".
